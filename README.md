# Redis-Moi-Ã‡a

This is a Sinatra-based web interface to manage redis databases.

## Usage

Once Sinatra and redis gems are installed, just run:

    ruby redismoica.rb

and point your browser to [http://localhost:4567/](http://localhost:4567/)

You'll have to logon to your Redis server by providing its *host* and *port*.

## Implemented methods

* KEYS
* INFO
* GET
* SET
* DEL
* INCR
* TTL
* EXPIRE
* LRANGE

As you can see... it's still a very young project.
