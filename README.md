# Redis-Moi-Ã‡a

This is a Sinatra-based web interface to manage redis databases.

## Usage

Once Sinatra and redis gems are installed, just run:

    ruby redismoica.rb

and point your browser to [http://localhost:4567/](http://localhost:4567/)

You'll have to logon to your Redis server by providing its *host* and *port*.

## Implemented methods

* KEYS (partial, no query support)
* INFO
* GET
* SET (partial, only works on existing keys)
* DEL
* INCR (partial, only works on existing keys)
* TTL
* EXPIRE
* LRANGE
* LPUSH (partial, only works on existing keys)
* RPUSH (partial, only works on existing keys)

As you can see... it's still a very young project.

**WARNING**: this program cannot create keys yet. It only works on existing keys.
